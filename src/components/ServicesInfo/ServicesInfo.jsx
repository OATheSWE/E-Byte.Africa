              Did you know that schools spend an average of 20 - 30 hours per
              week on administrative tasks that can be automated with our
              platform? By digitizing processes such as admissions, student
              records, and fee management, EduSolve not only saves valuable time
              but also reduces paper waste and associated costs. The average
              school spends 200,000 - 400,000 naira on paper each year â€“ imagine the
              impact of going paperless with our digital solution!
